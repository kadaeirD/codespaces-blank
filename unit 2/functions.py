# functions a- function is a set of code instructions
# FOR A COMPUTER TO FOLLOW

# A FUNCTION COMES IN 2 PHASES 

# PHASE 1; FUNCTION DENFINITON

def EXAMPLE():
    print (" GOODMORNING")       
    print ("GOOD DAY")      


# PHASE 2 FUNCTION CALL/ INVOCATION 
# WHEN WE WRITE ITO USE IT
# PRINT()
EXAMPLE()
input()

# function - is a set of code instructions labled under
# a custom name that the computer will run 

# functiom syntax (rules how its written)
# functions have 2 phases: function definition and
# function call
# phase 1: function definition 
# we are describing the instuction for our custom code
# we are addinf logic to the customers vocbulary.
# this code does not run- it only give the computer the meaning 
# not action
def example():
    print ('goodmoening') # 1 insturction : print good morning 
 # phase 2: function call
 # once we  have the definition, we can now the instuctions
 # by writing the function name
example    

# we indent to inform the computer that we are about to write
# code instuctions. if we dont, we will get an error
